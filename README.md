# Homework 1
Not 302 again!  

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1. allow students to explore using the Python programming language
2. review basic Object Oriented Principles
3. explore applying basic unit testing approaches

## Program
Create a Python [package](https://realpython.com/lessons/scripts-modules-packages-and-libraries/) of data structures.

### Package Requirements
Your package should include a List, a Queue, and a Stack data structure. A main driver is not necessary.

Do not use existing Python library functions, lists, queues, or stacks. Do not copy/paste code from any outside source.

### Testing Requirements
Create a suite of unit tests for your package which provides maximum coverage.
